inCHROMEnter
============

A simple Chrome extension to increment/decrement the URL of the current tab for fast browsing.

###Why
I got this idea when going through far too many sequential GitHub issues while grading for a course at my university. I wished there was a faster way to browse the issues than manually editing the URL, which conveniently ends in the issue number.

###Current features
+ Works on GitHub issues only right now.
+ Alt + '+' and Alt + '-' will increment/decrement,  in addition to the ugly buttons in the extension popup window.
  + The +/- keys on the numpad and the normal keyboard both work.

###Thanks to these sites/people:
